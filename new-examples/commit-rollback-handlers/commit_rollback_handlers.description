// Often code needs to get executed depending on whether a transaction committed.
// Testing the result of the commit within the transaction statement works, but inconvenient from a modularity perspective, particularly when you want to undo changes on rollback.
// This seems much worse in a distributed transaction, when transaction statement is in another program.
// Ballerina provides commit/rollback handlers which are functions that get run when decision whether to commit is known.
